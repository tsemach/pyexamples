If we see the output, we shall see that the two coroutines are executed concurrently. 
When we use yield from, the event loop knows that itâ€™s going to be busy 
for a while so it pauses execution of the coroutine and runs another. 
Thus two coroutines run concurrently (but not in parallel since the event loop is single threaded).
